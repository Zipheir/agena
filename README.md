# Agena

Agena is a minimal Gemini server written in CHICKEN Scheme. It
is designed to be used behind a TLS tunnel like `stunnel` or
`relayd`.

**Note:** I am no longer working on this software and I recommend
that you do not use it. The Gemini protocol is vague and unfinished.
I don't know whether this or any Gemini server can be said to
correctly implement the protocol.

Generally speaking, I think Gemini may be a mistake. I'm now serving
the content that I used to have on Gemini on the Web, as simple
XHTML. That, not Gemini, is what I recommend if you want a simple,
text-oriented browsing protocol.
